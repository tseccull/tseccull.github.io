Hi there! I'm an Applications Scientist for Astronomy and Quantum Imaging at 
[Oxford Instruments](https://andor.oxinst.com/). In this role, my experience 
working in astronomical research and instrumentation helps me to support 
customers and sales representatives in the application of Andor and First 
Light Imaging scientific cameras to astronomical and quantum research. I'm 
based at Oxford Instruments Andor in Belfast, Northern Ireland. 

Before joining OI I held a four year Science Fellowship at the [International 
Gemini Observatory](https://gemini.edu/) (itself a part of the US National 
Science Foundation's National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Laboratory, or 
[NOIRLab](http://noirlab.edu/)). In this role I was based at Gemini North in 
Hilo, Hawai'i, and my time was split equally between planetary science research
and  operational support of the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. I received my PhD
in Planetary Astronomy from [Queen's University Belfast](https://qub.ac.uk/) in 
2020, advised by Wesley Fraser (now at the Herzberg Institute of 
Astrophysics and the University of Victoria). I received my MSci in Physics 
with Astrophysics in 2015, also from QUB.

I make a living as an Applications Scientist and continue to actively research
the Solar System's minor planet populations in my free time. I'm most 
interested in studying the reflectance spectra of primitive and icy minor 
planets from the outer solar system (Trans-Neptunian Objects, Centaurs, 
Trojan Asteroids, and Comets) to measure their compositions. Uncovering the 
signatures of the materials that make up these objects informs us about their 
formation environment and how their surfaces have evolved over time. From this 
it's possible to infer details about the processes that sculpt planetary
systems. I also take an interest in the development of software tools and 
observational methods that can improve both the accuracy and precision of minor
planet spectra observed with ground-based telescopes. 
 
This site documents my work, including my research projects, software, 
contributions to publications, astronomical observations, and presentations at 
conferences.
